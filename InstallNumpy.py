#Types of Arrays:
    #Single Demensional Array
        #there is only one row and multiple columns
    #Multi-Dementinal Array
        #there are multiple rows and multiple columns
            #you can not use the array package to do this, instead you will need to import from numpy


import numpy as np

#by default, numpy is not a package that comes with Python
#we will need to install it by using PIP through the command prompt

#we will need to install pip first
#run the following in cmd:
    #python -m pip install numpy
