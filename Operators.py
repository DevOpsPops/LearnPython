#Types of Operators

    #Arithmatic Operators (see Math and strings.py)
        X+Y
        X*Y

    #Assignment Operators - assigning a value to a variable (=)
        X = X+2
        #OR
        X+=2 #adds 2 to itself
        X*=3 #multilies its self by 3
        #assigning multiple variables in the same line
            a,b = 5,6

    #Relational Operators - used to compare two values (<,>,<=,>=,!=,==)
        a<b
        a>b
        a==b

    #Logical Operators (And,Or,Not,Xor)
        a,b = 5,4
        a<8 and b<5
        a<8 and b<2 # for true with 'and' both expressions need to be true
        a<8 or b<2 # for true with 'or' at least one expression needs to be true
        x = True
        not x # not reverses the boolean logic
    #Unary Operators - used in negation (-) or nullifying a value, aka adding a minus symbol
    n = 7
    n = -n
